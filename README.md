# FreeTDS compiled by Navigating Cancer SRE

This is an unmodified build of FreeTDS 1.00.54, with certain features
enabled with compile flags. Mainly OpenSSL (which is not included in 
Debian/Ubuntu's apt repos, due to licensing issues mentioned below.)

This build sets a default TDS protocol version to 7.3 (SQL Server 2008). This can be overridden
via freetds.conf or by TinyTDS/any other client, so is merely a best fallback default.

See http://www.freetds.org/userguide/choosingtdsprotocol.htm for more information on TDS protocol versions.

### Compile Flags in this Package

* *`--with-openssl`* This is compiled with OpenSSL support. Requires OpenSSL > 1.0.1.
* *`--with-tdsver=7.3`* (As mentioned above)
* *`--enable-msdblib`* (Enable Microsoft behavior in the DB-Library API where it diverges from Sybase's.)
* *`--enable-krb5`* (Enable Kerberos support. With Kerberos you can connect to server using your stored Kerberos ticket.)
* *`--disable-debug`* (Removes debug symbols for performance)
