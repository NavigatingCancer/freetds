    Added support for configurable openssl cipher list

    Added new option to freetds.conf for specifying the cipher list
    supplied to openssl. This is necessary for several reasons:
    1. organizations that need more control over the specifics of
      encrypted connections
    2. to overcome the occasional incompatibility (sometimes intermittent)
       between open source encryption libraries and Microsoft's
       implementations. For example, several users reported intermittent
       connection problems where roughly 0.5% of connection attempts would
       fail for some reason. Removing specific key exchange protocols
       provided relief in at least one case.
    3. The cipher list can be specified in more generic terms, e.g.
       "HIGH:!SSLv2:!aNULL:-DH" rather than having to list specific cipher
       configurations that are otherwise subject to becoming outdated as
       the encryption landscape changes.

    Process batch statements without a select correctly

    If you send a batch of statements in a single call to the database, and
    these statements don't return rows, the dbresults function doesn't
    process the data correctly. It will loop over all data the first time it
    is called and return to the calling function that there are no more
    rows.

    Added a return on TDS_DONE_RESULT that stops processing data when a batch
    of statements doesn't contain a select.
